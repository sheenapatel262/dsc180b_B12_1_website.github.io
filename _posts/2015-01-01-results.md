## Results
- Forecasting traffic speeds for the upcoming 15 minutes consistently outperformed predictions for longer timeframes, demonstrating the model's strength in near-term accuracy. 
- The inclusion of extra features led to a dip in performance, likely attributed to the over-generalization of time to hourly increments rather than to more precise intervals. 
- Graphs using ST-GAT Edge Type generally performed better than its ST-GAT Single Edge counterpart which shows the importance of differentiating edge types. 
- Graphs containing Type 1 edges performed the best which may be due to the close proximity of our sensors and nearest neighbor speeds providing the most reliable information for predicting a target sensor's speed.
        
## Future Work
- Make data collection process automated for more efficient retrieval of sensor data
- Collect sensor data that extends a longer time frame to increase sample size for model training
- Integrate other highways in San Diego County to capture more highway relations
- Explore advanced optimization techniques such as Grid Search Cross Validation to optimize hyperparameters
- Incorporate additional features that factor into traffic patterns such as weather and lane closures to enrich feature vectors 
- Integrate real-time feedback mechanisms into prediction models to enable continuous learning and adaptation to changing traffic and feature conditions
