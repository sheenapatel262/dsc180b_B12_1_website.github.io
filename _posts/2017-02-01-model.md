## Summary: Construction of Models

For traffic speed prediction, we adopt the **Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (ST-GAT)** proposed by Zhang, Yu, and Liu (2019). ST-GAT efficiently integrates spatial relationships and temporal variations within the network, enabling precise traffic forecasting. Two variants of ST-GAT are introduced in our graph implementations: **ST-GAT Single Edge** and **ST-GAT Edge Type**.

### ST-GAT Single Edge:

- Utilizes a **Graph Attention (GAT)** layer to aggregate neighboring node features in a linear manner
- Enhances traditional **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** with self-attention mechanisms.
- Employs **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** layers for capturing temporal characteristics.
- Employs a **linear output layer** for generating traffic speed forecasts.

### ST-GAT Edge Type:

- Segregates graph signals based on edge types to discern their importance.
- Applies GAT layer independently to each edge type for unique feature embeddings.
- Utilizes LSTM layers for capturing temporal dependencies.
- Employs a **linear output layer** for generating traffic speed forecasts.

## Experiments:

- **Datasets:** Used 3 main SD highway networks.
- **Setup:** Split dataset into training, validation, and test subsets. And used implemented the six distinct graph datasets to 
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) metrics.
